<h1>IOXIO Tags&trade; signatures</h1>

<p>Technical details about the signatures used with IOXIO Tags&trade;.</p>

<SectionTitle>Header</SectionTitle>
<p>
  The signed codes start with an identifier to designate that they are an IOXIO Tags&trade; code,
  including a version number. Right now the header used is the characters <em>IT1:</em>.
</p>

<SectionTitle>Encoded signed data</SectionTitle>
<p>
  Following the header there is the signed data, encoded in <A
    href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9285/">Base45</A
  >, used commonly in e.g. the EU COVID passports and other standards where QR codes need to be used
  to represent arbitrary binary data.
</p>

<p>
  The data is signed with <A href="https://cose-wg.github.io/cose-spec/">COSE</A> (CBOR Object Signing
  and Encryption), effectively a version of the JOSE system but for CBOR, and <A
    href="https://cbor.io">CBOR</A
  > itself is a more efficiently packed binary friendly format similar to JSON.
</p>

<p>
  By parsing the COSE signature without verifying it, you should be able to get the JWKS <em>kid</em
  >
  and <em>alg</em>
  from the COSE header, as well as the payload. You can use the <em>iss</em> from the payload to
  fetch the <a href="/tags/metadata/#product-passport.json">product-passport.json</a>, which points
  to the <a href="/tags/metadata/#jwks.json">jwks.json</a>. Once you load that file, you can use the
  other properties to determine the correct key to verify the signature with.
</p>

<p>
  Check out the <em>verify_code</em> function in <A
    href="https://github.com/ioxiocom/ioxio-tags/blob/main/api/app/tag.py">our demo application</A
  > for a full example.
</p>

<SectionTitle>Payload</SectionTitle>
<p>
  Once the COSE data is parsed, you will get the properties of the code, so the <em>iss</em>,
  <em>product</em>, and <em>id</em>, from it.
</p>

<p>
  The data is signed with <A href="https://cose-wg.github.io/cose-spec/">COSE</A> (CBOR Object Signing
  and Encryption), effectively a version of the JOSE system but for CBOR, and <A
    href="https://cbor.io">CBOR</A
  > itself is a more efficiently packed binary friendly format similar to JSON.
</p>

<SectionTitle>Example signed code</SectionTitle>
<p>
  The line feeds are added to make it easier to see what the code is like, but are not a part of the
  code. Having extra linefeeds breaks the code.
